  <h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Peptide</h2>
  <p>I gave myself 2 mg of CJC-1295 with DAC once per week for six weeks. I used a clean insulin syringe to inject subcutaneously. I stored the vial at –20 °C and reconstituted it with bacteriostatic water before each dose.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Energy levels</li>
    <li>Muscle soreness</li>
    <li>Sleep quality</li>
    <li>Body weight and measurements</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I also asked three friends to note any visible changes in my physique.</p>

  <h2>Results and Ranking</h2>
  <p>After two weeks, I felt less soreness after workouts. By week four, I noticed lean muscle gains without extra body fat. Sleep improved by week three, with deeper and longer sleep cycles.</p>
